## Technical Implementation Details

### Shopify API Client (Implemented)
```typescript
// Core pattern for API requests with production-ready error handling
async function executeQuery(query: string, variables?: any, retries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < retries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const result = await shopifyClient.request(query, variables);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle network errors differently
      if (isNetworkError(error)) {
        await exponentialBackoff(attempt);
        continue;
      }
      // Log authentication errors
      if (isAuthError(error)) {
        logAuthError(error);
        refreshToken();
        continue;
      }
      // Handle rate limiting
      if (isRateLimitError(error)) {
        await handleRateLimit(error);
        continue;
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
  throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
}
```

### Enhanced Product Query with Caching
```typescript
// Get product by handle with caching
export async function getProduct(handle: string) {
  // Check cache first
  const cached = await productCache.get(`product:${handle}`);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
  
  // Fetch from API if not cached
  const { product } = await executeQuery(PRODUCT_QUERY, { handle });
  const transformed = transformProductData(product);
  
  // Store in cache with TTL
  await productCache.set(
    `product:${handle}`, 
    JSON.stringify(transformed), 
    { ttl: 60 * 15 } // 15 minutes
  );
  
  return transformed;
}

// Get all products with pagination and caching
export async function getAllProducts(first = 20, after = null) {
  const cacheKey = `products:${first}:${after || 'start'}`;
  const cached = await productCache.get(cacheKey);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
  
  const { products } = await executeQuery(PRODUCTS_QUERY, { first, after });
  const result = {
    products: products.edges.map(({ node }) => transformProductData(node)),
    pageInfo: products.pageInfo,
  };
  
  await productCache.set(
    cacheKey, 
    JSON.stringify(result), 
    { ttl: 60 * 5 } // 5 minutes
  );
  
  return result;
}
```

### Production-Ready Data Transformation
```typescript
// Transform Shopify data to application format with validation
function transformProductData(product) {
  if (!product) return null;
  
  // Handle missing data cases gracefully
  const priceRange = product.priceRange || { minVariantPrice: {} };
  const minPrice = priceRange.minVariantPrice || {};
  
  return {
    id: product.id,
    title: product.title || 'Untitled Product',
    handle: product.handle,
    description: product.description || '',
    price: minPrice.amount || '0.00',
    currencyCode: minPrice.currencyCode || 'USD',
    images: (product.images?.edges || []).map(({ node }) => ({
      url: optimizeImageUrl(node.url),
      altText: node.altText || product.title || 'Product image',
      width: node.width,
      height: node.height,
    })),
    variants: (product.variants?.edges || []).map(({ node }) => ({
      id: node.id,
      title: node.title || 'Default Variant',
      availableForSale: node.availableForSale ?? false,
      price: node.price?.amount || minPrice.amount || '0.00',
      currencyCode: node.price?.currencyCode || minPrice.currencyCode || 'USD',
      selectedOptions: node.selectedOptions || [],
      quantityAvailable: node.quantityAvailable || 0,
    })),
    seo: {
      title: product.seo?.title || product.title || '',
      description: product.seo?.description || product.description?.substring(0, 160) || '',
    },
    collections: (product.collections?.edges || []).map(({ node }) => ({
      id: node.id,
      title: node.title,
      handle: node.handle,
    })),
  };
}

// Image URL optimization helper
function optimizeImageUrl(url) {
  if (!url) return '/placeholder.jpg';
  // Add image optimization parameters
  return url.includes('?') 
    ? `${url}&width=600&quality=80` 
    : `${url}?width=600&quality=80`;
}
```
